Some JavaFX user interface controls to work with Git repositories.
Basically it's just a bunch of wrappers around [JGit](http://eclipse.org/jgit/).

A compiled and ready-to-use version of this library can be found in the
Sonatype OSS Maven Repository (oss.sonatype.org). To use the library
in your Maven based projects just add the following lines to your
'pom.xml':

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.cathive.fx</groupId>
  <artifactId>fx-git</artifactId>
  <version>${fx-git.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
